                    <p>Hi, I&CloseCurlyQuote;m Katherine, a UX/UI designer who transforms complexity into clarity. I design with empathy, precision, and a deep understanding of human behavior, crafting experiences that guide, engage, and empower. Based in Toronto, I&CloseCurlyQuote;m passionate about solving the right problems through meaningful collaboration.</p>

                                <h4>Project Summary</h4>
                                <p>Redesigned a complex, multi-screen account overview page to address user frustration with excessive scrolling and poor performance. Created a customizable card system that improved both user experience and technical performance while satisfying competing stakeholder needs.</p>
                                <h4>The Challenge</h4>
                                <p>The Account Overview page was a critical but problematic interface:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>User frustration:</strong> Frequently-needed data was buried at the bottom of a multi-screen page requiring constant scrolling</li>
                                    <li><strong>Performance issues:</strong> Page loaded slowly because it queried the database for every card simultaneously &mdash; essentially loading an entire account's worth of data at once.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Stakeholder tension:</strong> Management wanted a redesign, developers flagged technical constraints, users had varying data priorities</li>
                                </ul>

                        <h4>My Role & Approach</h4>
                        <p>I took ownership of this project after recognizing that multiple stakeholders were describing different aspects of the same core problem. Rather than treat these as separate issues, I listened to all perspectives and looked for a unified solution.</p>

                            <li><strong>User feedback analysis:</strong> Identified that different users needed different data priorities, but all suffered from the "scroll to find" problem </li>
                            <li><strong>Technical investigation:</strong> Understood that loading all cards simultaneously created avoidable slowness</li>
                            <li><strong>Stakeholder mapping:</strong> Recognized that a customizable solution could address performance, usability, and management goals simultaneously</li>

                        <p>This project reinforced the value of listening to multiple stakeholders and looking for systemic solutions rather than addressing symptoms. By treating performance issues and user experience problems as interconnected, I found a solution that improved both while giving users control over their workflow.</p>
                        <p>The only thing I would do differently is design the new controls to accommodate different screen sizes more gracefully. While the Product directive was desktop-only at the time, a shift toward responsive design happened shortly after implementation. I had actually been advocating for this dynamic approach throughout the app, but chose a conservative solution to ensure smooth adoption during the organizational transition.</p>

I created an SVG-based solution that generated leads for 2+ years while helping clients meet federal requirements.

                                <p>Looking back, I now realize the solution could have been even simpler &mdash; the SVGs could be generated entirely with client-side JavaScript, eliminating the need for back-end development and server infrastructure. This would have reduced both development time and ongoing maintenance costs while making the tool faster to deploy.</p>

                            <h4>Role</h4>
                            <p>UI Design & Business Analysis</strong></p>

                            <h4>Project summary</h4>
                            <p>Led UI design and business analysis for a secure financial application with real-time personalization preview. I proved WYSIWYG functionality was possible when developers said it couldn't be done, using innovative SVG and CSS solutions.</p>

                            <h4>The Challenge</h4>
                            <p>Design a modern, mobile-first web application for ordering personalized cheques with real-time preview. The competition’s legacy system hadn&rsquo;t been updated in decades, and tight security protocols limited user testing to immediate Agile team members only.</p>

                            <p>When stakeholders requested WYSIWYG preview but developers said it was impossible, I built a proof-of-concept using SVG, HTML, and CSS to demonstrate real-time text updates and element control. This led to an innovative solution: one global SVG containing all design variants, with CSS-controlled layers and plain-text elements that could be dynamically updated via JavaScript.</p>

                <h3>Project Summary</h3>

                <p>Beaches Wellness Centre is a well-established chiropractic and registered massage therapy clinic in Toronto&rsquo;s Beaches neighbourhood. As one of their patients, I went to leave a voicemail for them one day, but first wanted to double-check their hours to make sure I wouldn&rsquo;t be bothering them right at the end of the day... and discovered they didn&rsquo;t have a web site.</p>

                <p>Since I needed portfolio work I could show in public without violating my employer&rsquo;s security regulations, I asked if I could make a web site for them, and they agreed.</p>

                <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                <p>After some discussions, the proposed site&rsquo;s goals were determined:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Feasible: </strong> the site must be low-cost to create and maintain.</li>
                    <li><strong>Accessible: </strong>although the business does not fall under AODA regulations, it made sense to implement WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility for a brand-new site.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ease of content management: </strong>After initial implementation, the clinic wanted to be able to update the site themselves.</li>
                    <li><strong>Responsive: </strong>The design had to be mobile-first, but also support tablet and larger-screen visits.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>A brief was created which listed the project goals, constraints, major deliverables, and other major details.</p>

                <p><strong>Overarching constraint: </strong>COVID placed a lot of restrictions on physical space and time. The clinic&rsquo;s waiting room was shut down; patients had to wait outside the building before their appointments. The clinic&rsquo;s volumes also went up, so time to meet with the stakeholders was minimal. It wasn&rsquo;t unusual for the clinic owner and I to talk about next steps <em>during</em> my appointment, simply because it was the only time we had to discuss anything with each other.</p>

                    <h3>Research</h3>

                </summary>

                <p>Research focused on three topics:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Competition: </strong>what do the websites of the other clinics in the neighbourhood look like? what content do they have?</li>
                    <li><strong>Existing patients: </strong>what do the existing patients want in a website? What would they find useful? (Note that nearly all clinic patients are referred by word of mouth, so existing patients are considered the primary audience for a site.)</li>
                    <li><strong>Information architecture: </strong>in what order should the website provide the content? How should information be grouped? What are the major content topics?</li>
                </ul>

                <p>I created a competitive analysis of 13 different clinics, mostly from the neighbourhood, a few in adjacent communities. The analysis noted the purpose of the site, the colour scheme, the main menu items, the core content, what services are offered, and whether or not the site had been updated recently.</p>

                <div class="triptych" style="text-align: center;">
                    <div>
                        <a href="img/caPresentation.png"><img src="img/caPresentation.png" width="75%" height="auto" aria-hidden="true" alt="bar graph showing most popular menu items on competitve web sites" style="border: var(--color) 8px solid; border-radius: 8px;"></a>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>Chiropractors are not allowed to compete against each other directly (ie: they can&rsquo;t say anything like, &OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;Best in Toronto!&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;), so it was important to find out how to stand out in a way that complied with professional standards.</p>

                <p>The analysis revealed that there were two major ways to both stand out as a website and to comply with the standards:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Choose a colour scheme which wasn&rsquo;t the same as the other sites, which tended to draw from a limited set of pallettes</li>
                    <li>Order the information in a way that appealed to patients</li>
                </ul>

                <p>I then did a card sort with patient volunteer participants, to determine which menu items were most important to them.</p>

                <div class="illoContainer">
                    <img src="img/similarity-matrix.svg" width="80%" height="auto" aria-hidden="true" alt="similarity matrix from menu card sort">
                </div>
               
                <p><strong>Existing patients: </strong>I decided to take advantage of the restrictions COVID had placed on patient access, and use the time waiting outside for appointments to talk to other patients informally and learn what they expected from a website. Sometimes we would look at competition websites together as well.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Information architecture: </strong>I used <a href="https://www.optimalworkshop.com/">Optimal Workshop <span class="fas fa-external-link-alt" title="external link"></span><span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a> to create a card sorting exercise, based on the most popular menu items revealed in the competitive analysis and topics patients had mentioned. Patients were invited to complete it, and to share the link if they wanted. This gave me enough data to determine the major content for the website, and in how it should be organized.</p>

                <p>Having established a creative brief and conducted user research in the <a href="#bwcResearch">first phase</a> of the project, I still needed to research UI elements before I started sketching mock-ups.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Colour scheme: </strong>the competitive analysis from the Research phase showed that most competing local sites used blues, greens, oranges, or greys as their major colours. The stakeholders and I both searched independently for inspirational sites to get ideas for a colour scheme, and both of us brought forward different sites with a black &amp; slightly off-white colour scheme with dark gold accents.</p>

                <div class="illoContainer">
                    <img src="img/colourScheme.svg" width="300" height="auto" aria-hidden="true" alt="light and dark colour schemes for Beaches Wellness Centre project" class="illo illoBorder">
                </div>
                
                <p><strong>Navigation elements: </strong>the two menu options for mobile were a hamburger menu, or a button bar at the bottom of the screen. The stakeholders and I agreed to conduct <strong>A/B testing</strong> to determine which was best.</p>

                    <li>It confirmed that mobile-first was the best way to go &mdash; many patients just assumed they would be using their phone to access the site, and that they would be using the site en route to an appointment, or when they were otherwise not at home.</li>
                    <li>Patients strongly preferred a one-page layout, so they could thumb-scroll over using links or another navigation method. If they clicked to another page on a sample site, they would try to scroll back to home rather than clicking on the Home link in the menu.</li>
                    <li>Each screen&rsquo;s worth of information should be tightly-focused and kept to a minimum. Patients didn&rsquo;t like a lot of content on a screen at once.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>By focusing on the data and the research results, very little elements were left up for discussion. Most choices can be traced back to the user research, competitive analysis, and the original brief from the stakeholders.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Key information for the home page was identified during the interviews.</li>
                    <li>The results of the card sorting exercise are used to drive the content organization.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Organized content according to the card sort results</li>
                    <li>Created mini design system using Rangle.io Radius template; create responsive grid</li>
                    <li>Collected assets</li>
                    <li>Developed responsive wireframes (mobile &rightarrow; tablet &rightarrow; desktop)</li>
                    <li>Addressed accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA) and color contrast challenges</li>
                    <li>A/B tested navigation options (hamburger vs button bar)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>After a few initial review rounds with the stakeholders, two versions of the interactive wireframes were tested with patients:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hamburger menu: </strong>the traditional hamburger menu was shown at the top of the mobile view, with a menu drawer which appeared when the visitor tapped the hamburger icon.</li>
                    <li><strong>Button bar: </strong>a button bar was added to the bottom of the mobile screen, with only the major sections (Home, News, About) shown as buttons.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>I made a temporary &ldquo;secret&rdquo; link on each version of the home page so that testers could switch between the hamburger menu and button bar solutions easily, showed the vistors how to switch between the two solutions, and asked them to find different sections. The testers also read through the wireframes while chatting with me informally (essentially <strong>guerilla testing</strong>).</p>

                <p>The prototype was tested on multiple screens with Wellness Centre staff and patients.</p>

                        <p><strong>Gold text</strong> is tricky to implement because it&rsquo;s in the medium range for hex values and it can be challenging to find sufficient contrast to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards. This was mitigated by using slightly different shades of gold against the black and white backgrounds to ensure each background had sufficient contrast.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>The About section</strong> has three subsections, which makes it the longest section. Research indicated it would also be the least-visited part of the site. Therefore, to keep the menu short and simple, the subsections were removed from the main menu. Links at the top of each About subsection allow vistors to navigate quickly within the main section.</p>

                <p>The final design solution incorporated feedback from the testing phase and addressed the identified issues. Key features included:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes</li>
                    <li>Clear navigation options that prioritize user needs</li>
                    <li>Accessible design elements that meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards</li>
                    <li>Flexible sections which allowed for easy editing (holiday hours, event messaging)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The design was approved by the client, but they chose not to incoporate it because they already had more patients than they could handle.</p>

                </summary>

                <p>The conventional wisdom is to sell a small business by showing the products and services available, and <em>then</em> list the contact information/book an appointment as a call to action. The patients I interviewed preferred to find out the contact information and location <em>first</em>, and then contact the clinic to determine if the services fit their needs.</p>
                <p>It was noted in the brief that minimal content was preferred by the stakeholders, but the patient interviews indicated content and layout should be even more minimal than previously supposed. Rather than read about the available services on a website, patients reported they would rather have a discussion about it in the context of their personal state of health.</p>

                <p>There were never really any major showstoppers in the process because the business owner and other business stakeholders were kept informed throughout the process. The only time I did an experiment on my own was when I redesigned the home page, and even then the feedback loop was strong enough that they were able to choose from the samples I made quickly so we could move on to evaluating the update with guerilla testing.</p>

                <p>Using the Radius mini-design system let the stakeholders and I build up a set of design conventions which complied with accessibility standards very quickly and easily.</p>

                <p>
                    I consume a <em>lot</em> of media about design commentary. Every week I receive nnGroup&rsquo;s AlertBox newsletter, listen to a couple of podcasts, and read some articles, not to mention attending webinars. Before the pandemic, I was a regular attendee of the local Design System Meetup, and still attend online.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One recurring theme I noticed was warnings about not using overly themed, overly &ldquo;off the shelf&rdquo; portfolio designs. Usually the author would state it was all right to start from a template, but if you didn&rsquo;t personalize it... well, what were you showing people about what you could do?
                </p>

                <p>
                    Not only did I completely agree with that, but I also have the challenge that the strict security I work under means I can&rsquo;t show anything that I have actually worked on from work unless it has been made public (and since we are overwhelmingly B:B in our focus, none of it has been).
                </p>

                <p>
                    It was also important to me to write everything from scratch. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I&rsquo;ve used a lot of Bootstrap (often with React) at work, but it seemed to me that a Bootstrap site just proved I knew Bootstrap. I wanted to show how a site looked if I wrote it from scratch.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Besides, it sounded like fun.

                <p>
                    The first thing I did was look at a lot of people&rsquo;s design portfolios, and at a lot of portfolio templates. I didn&rsquo;t want to use any of the templates directly, just get ideas for how to organize and present the information. I also conducted a <strong>self-branding exercise</strong> with some trusted colleagues. We all did our own profiles and then critqued each other&rsquo;s work.</p>
                
                <p>
                    I then outlined how I wanted the portfolio to look and how I wanted to approach the work.

                <p>I was involved with hiring two additional UX designers, reviewing resumes and portfolios, and conducting first-round interviews with another team member.

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>accessibility</strong> as part of the foundation, not an afterthought</li>
                    <li><strong>minimal shortcuts & other people&rsquo;s work:</strong> style kits like Bootstrap and template platforms like Wix are great for speeding up projects, but not for showing what you know</li>
                    <li><strong>product attitude:</strong> this is a product like any other I&rsquo;ve worked on, and has gone through iterations like anything else I&rsquo;ve done in a team setting</li>
                    <li><strong>process and impact:</strong> ensure the process was both clearly stated, and clearly demonstrated</li>
                    <li><strong>include a team:</strong> since on a real project I would be working with a team and receiving/incorporating feedback, I created a team of &ldquo;stakeholders&rdquo; from a group of peers &mdash; we critique and help each other regularly.</li>

                    </summary>

                <p> The site you&rsquo;re looking at now was inspired by three different portfolio templates. Instead of just blindly copying & pasting code, I wrote all the semantic HTML myself, using the templates as visual guides.</p>

                    <p><strong>Structure</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The CSS started with a copy of the <strong>classless</strong> <a href="https://andybrewer.github.io/mvp/" target="_blank">mvp.css <span class="fas fa-external-link-alt" title="external link"></span><span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a> template, which was then expanded and updated to suit the content and theme. The advantage of using mvp.css as a foundation is that it strongly encourages the use of <strong>semantic HTML</strong>, that is, HTML whose tags largely indicate the purpose of each tag set (as opposed to, say, just using &lt;div&gt; tags for each content block).</li>
                        <li>Semantic HTML also makes it easier to meet WCAG accessibility standards, since that&rsquo;s that WCAG includes in its standards.</li>
                        <li>I decided to keep all the content in one long page, rather than having users flip back and forth between the main page and each case study. It does make for a long page, but the navigation lets users skip from section to section, and people who want to read all the content can simply scroll.</li>
                    </ul>   

                    <p><strong>Look & feel</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The section, button, and link colours are all based on the entry page conceptual image (a photo I took at a Winter Stations festival).</li>
                        <li>Margins, spacing, and letter/word spacing added whitespace without sacrificing readability.</li>
